## Test Cases
These are a few test cases, showing what results to expect when certain actions are performed:
1. Register new user: if you fill out registration form and then click on “Register”, new user info is saved in the database and the user can log in.
2. Login failure: if you enter wrong password while logging in, an error message is displayed: “Incorrect password”.
3. Spin the roulette: if you choose difficulty and then click on “Spin the Roulette!”, a random challenge of the chosen difficulty is displayed.
4. Update stats: if you click on “Challenge Completed!” after completing the task, success rate and challenges completed are updated.
5. Responsive layout: if you resize the browser window to mobile dimensions, elements are readjusted so that the content remains readable.
